# BucketList 
Project 14 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. This app introduces three new elements- MapKit, FaceID and using MVVM architecture. 
The app first asks for FaceID in order to be granted access. The user is then presented with a map which they can change between hybrid mode and standard.
They can they tap on the map to add a new destination pin. They can click back into this pin to edit its name, add a description and see other recommended places nearby.
